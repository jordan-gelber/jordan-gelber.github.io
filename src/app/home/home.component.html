          <p>
            I recently graduated from Denison University with a degree in Computer
            Science and a minor in Philosophy. Through my studies, I developed
            an interest in discovering problems and creating solutions, through
            programming and philosophical study.

            As an engineer, I'm interested in building applications that prioritize user
            experience as well as accountable, collaborative engineering. I hope
            to build products that meet the client's needs and generate interesting
            questions for the development team to solve.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently looking for a full-time position as a software engineer in
            the Boston area.
